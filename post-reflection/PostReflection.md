### A Beginner's Insight Into Creative Coding

When I first entered CART253, I was, and still am to a certain extent, a complete beginner in programming. My experience was limited to self-taught HTML and CSS using template codes. I was completly clueless as to what I should expect from the course and what we would be doing beyon the abstract concept of creative coding. Javascript, Python ect.. to me were not creative at all. Coding seemed very strict and procedural. However, through the 3 main creative projects of this course (art jam, mod jam & variation jam), I am happy to be proven wrong and am now beginning to understand how to think creatively through code. Programming is not one size fits all solution where you can just plug and play. It's like every other creative field, there is a problem that needs solving and there are multiple ways to solve it.

The first project, Art Jam, was my first dip into the ocean that is coding. I created a pixel self-portrait, placing each rectangle individually on the canvas. At the time, this felt like a huge program, and I struggled with simply understanding how x and y coordinates translated to positions on the canvas. Every shape and every color had to be manually coded which so different from what I was used to doing using adobe programs. However, this project taught me the importance of drawing order, the relationship between coordinates and dimensions, and the basics of fill, stroke, and noStroke. Initially, this felt like a waste of time because that same image would have taken me 1/10th of the time to create on photoshop, until, I discovered the power of event handling. The mouseClicked() function, opened up a whole new world for me. It simply allowed me to toggle jewelry on and off in the portrait but this was my first true encounter with interactive coding where I realized why people would pick p5js over photoshop. Really dramatically put, it was like coding is God's life breath and the shapes is the clay scultpure that is being given a soul.

While Art Jam taught me the technical foundations, Mod Jam pushed me to think in terms of systems. I created a game called Frog of Destiny, inspired by mythical frogs from Greek and Chinese traditions. Unlike Art Jam, this project required organizing complex behavior and responding to multiple interactions simultaneously. The game had multiple modes, moving objects, collision detection, a scoring system, and dynamic feedback for the player. Implementing this required integrating many technical concepts I had just learned like conditionals for game logic, distance calculations for collision detection, objects to represent the frog and the flying objects, and state management through the gamemode variable. I also had to preload images and fonts, animate objects across frames, and use timers to track events such as the “greed penalty” in Fortune Mode. It was a lot for a beginner but what made Mod Jam truly transformative was how my creative motivation drove my learning. I had no prior experience making games, but the idea of a the mystical frog game propelled me to figure out how to realize that vision. I dove into tutorials, explored Codedex.io, p5js.org and even learned through TikTok breakdowns. This obssession with learning the language felt very similar to when I first learn graphic design and was watching and reading everything that was recommended. The creative concept behind the project gave me a drive to learn how to code properly because I would have hated to turn in something that didn't represent my idea. For the first time, I saw programming as a medium and not merely a set of instructions or an obligation to stay relevant in this day and age.

The final project, Variation Jam, cemented this shift. Building on my previous work with the mystical frog, I was able to explore more freely, experimenting with variations of the game and new ideas. I implemented loops for the creation of the menu lists, and although I still struggle with fully understanding the purpose of the variable i, this project gave me a chance to practice applying loops in a creative context. Arrays became a practical way to organize the different game modes and manage objects efficiently. I also realized the importance of clean code organization and commenting. I wrote a large draw function that was very fragile and prone to crashing the game whenever something was amiss. This motivated me to think about structuring my programs more thoughtfully in the future. Variation Jam also highlighted the importance of connecting coding concepts to familiar ideas. I found it helpful to think of each game state as a new page on a website, something I already understood from my previous experience with web design. This connection simplified state management and helped me approach coding with more confidence. I felt moments of flow while experimenting with variations, testing interactions, and adjusting visual and gameplay elements. This experience showed me how creative coding is not only about solving technical problems, but also about exploring ideas and iterating.

Reflecting on these three projects, the most significant change in my programming knowledge has been moving from procedural thinking to dynamic thinking. I have learned to structure programs using functions and objects, manage state, handle user input, animate elements over time, and integrate interactivity in meaningful ways. Concepts that once felt abstract, like arrays and loops, now have practical applications in my work. I have also gained resilience when debugging and problem-solving rather than being frustrated by errors, I now see them as opportunities to understand my code and make it better. This new programming knowledge has deeply influenced my creativity. My understanding of creative code has evolved from seeing it as a technical skill separate from art, to recognizing it as a medium in which ideas, logic, and visuals intersect. I look forward to exploring how computational tools can enable forms of expression that are impossible through traditional graphic design methods or even simply how to merge the two. Ultimately, this course has transformed the way I relate to programming. I began with uncertainty and hesitation, limited to manual pixel placement and basic logic. Through Art Jam, I gained foundational knowledge of p5.js and event handling. Through Mod Jam, I discovered how to structure interactive systems and integrate assets into a playable experience. Through Variation Jam, I explored variations, loops, arrays, and the concept of state, and I began to enter the flow of creative coding. Through the course, I have gained the technical skills, creative confidence, and mindset to continue evolving in this exciting intersection of code and art.
