## Description

Frog of Destiny is a myth-inspired, frog tongue catching game where the player controls a
mystical frog that seeks either wisdom or fortune.

There are 4 modes:

In Ancient Greek mythology, frogs were often associated with prophecy. So in the game Greek Oracle Game, there will be two types of flying prophetical orbs: Golden Truthful Prophecies and Purple False Prophecies. The Frog will have to eat the Golden Truthful Prophecies to gain as many Wisdom Points before the time ends. If the Frog eats the Purple False Prophecies, the frog dies.

In Chinese Mythology, Chan Chu (蟾蜍) is the Three-Legged Mythical Frog that brings fortune.
So in the Chinese Fortune Game, the frog will have to catch as many Golden Coins as possible before the time runs out. However, if the frog catches the Golden Coins too quickly, he will lose Fortune Points because of greed.

In Ancient Egyptian mythology, frogs symbolized rebirth and renewal through the goddess Heqet, who breathes life into the newly born. In the Egyptian Rebirth Game, the frog must catch glowing Nile Blessings, which represent the life-giving floodwaters that sustained Egypt. Each blessing strengthens the frog’s Vitality Score. But the frog must avoid the sacred Rebirth Sigils, mystical ankh symbols of resurrection. If the frog touches a Rebirth Sigil, it is instantly pulled back into the eternal cycle of life and reborn, forcing the game to restart.

In classic Western fairytales, frogs are often enchanted beings cursed in frog form waiting to be released by true love's kiss. In the Western Fairy Tale Game, the player decides their destiny: either catch True Love’s Kiss to gain Love Points and follow the path of romance and virtue, or catch Crowns of Power to gain Power Points and pursue wealth and dominion over the land. The frog must focus carefully, because catching the wrong symbols or mixing them up slows progress and can prevent the player from reaching their goal before time runs out. Each choice shapes the outcome of the story, revealing a
different ending based on the frog’s priorities.

 Instructions:
 - Move the frog with your mouse
 - Click to launch the tongue
