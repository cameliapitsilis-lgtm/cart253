/**
 * Frog of Destiny
 * Camélia Pitsilis
 
 * Frog of Destiny is a myth-inspired, frog tongue catching game where the player controls a
   mystical frog that seeks either wisdom or fortune.

 There are two modes: Greek Oracle Frog and Chinese Fortune Frog.

 In Ancient Greek mythology, frogs were often associated with prophecy. So in the game Greek Oracle Frog Game,
 there will be two types of flying prophetical orbs: Golden Truthful Prophecies and Purple False Prophecies.
 The Frog will have to eat the Golden Truthful Prophecies to gain as many Wisdom Points before the time ends.
 If the Frog eats the Purple False Prophecies, the frog dies.
 
 In Chinese Mythology, Chan Chu (蟾蜍) is the Three-Legged Mythical Frog that brings fortune.
 So in the Chinese Fortune Frog Game, the frog will have to catch as many Golden Coins as possible
 before the time runs out. However, if the frog catches the Golden Coins too quickly, he will lose
 Fortune Points because of greed.
 
 Instructions:
 - Move the frog with your mouse
 - Click to launch the tongue
 - Catch object
