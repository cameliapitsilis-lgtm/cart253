## Apologies Pippin, I seem to have brainstormed games without thinking of the frog. I will incorporate him in the games starting now.

16. Add Features to the frog and Fly // What would I add? Buldging Eyes? Do the Eyes Track? Does the Fly have Wings?

17. Lazy Frog hitchhicking on the back of other animals // What kind of Animals? Do we control the animals movements or the frogs? 

18. Frog builds poop/dirt pile to attract flies // Does the fly catch the poop and the dirt the same way he does the fly? Do flies only come when is complete? How stinky does it have to be?

19. Night Vision Frog Game // Would have to include a time element to shift from day to night mode. What does night vision in frog look like? Or should I do military night vision vibe instead?

20. Frog is a Shapeshifter and can catch bigger prey // The frog would turn into a human hybrid frog with an extendable tongue to catch bigger prey.

21. Utilize frog quirks like swimming, wall climbing, jump, mucus secretion and hibernation in the game. // What commands theses quirks? How will I show those quirks? Does the screen change anytime the quirk is activated? 

22. Find the Prince Frog to kiss // Frogs would all look the same and it's basically a guessing game. Score goes up when u get one and goes down when you smooch a frog. Does the screen change when it's a prince? Unlock any perks?

23. The frog is fly and the frog is a witch brewing a potion // Basically the frog becomes the prey and the witch the hunter. Witch would be flying and catch the frog with a net.

24. Frog's role changes depending on myths and culture // The frog will always be catching something but the look of him the decor around and what he catches depends on what culture he is part of. What cultures should I chose?

25. Frog finds the flower with the bug // There will be a bunch of flowers and inside there is hidden bugs. Some a poisonous some feed him. 

26. Uncatchable fly and frog gets mad // We will be controlling the fly and the more we evade the frog the madder it gets until it explodes. How are we gonna automate the frog?

27. Frog can eat everything on screen make sure you aim well // The frog will be able to eat the titlte, the scoreboard, the background, anything on screen. The game ends when he is in a void.

28. Counter goes up everytime you miss the fly not when you catch it // Is the frog straving and when the counter goes to zero he dies? 

29. Different food on screen but only thing frog can eat is flies // Bunch of different things will fly on screen but the frog dies if he eats anything but the fly. What items are gonna be included?

30. The more you catch flies the more warts appear on the frog. Game ends when frog is full of warts // Why? lol

31. Game ends when the frog takes up the full space on canvas. Frogs gets fatter and fatter the more he eats. // Glutonous frog know no bound. Should we change the space the frog is in as he gets bigger and bigger to make the game longer? Starts in earth, then in space, then in a black hole? What's after space? Does the frog eat god and it's the end of the world?

32. The score unlocks new magical powers that help catch the flies. // What are the powers? What do the powers change in the game?

33. Add ASMR audio of frog eating. Frog Mukbang. // How and what kind of audio? What is the Frog eating?

34. King frog eats princesses with a kiss. // Instead of tongue stretching it's lips.

35. Stupid frog collects bait instead of just eating the flies. // The frog is stupid and works on catching bait to attract flies instead of just eating the flies.

36. Flies find tactics to disable the frog so it isnt eaten. // We would control the flies and we would use stuff frogs hate like lemon or sound to disable the frog momentarly so we can escape.
