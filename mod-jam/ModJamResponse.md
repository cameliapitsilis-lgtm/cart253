## Camelia's Mod Jam Response

### Émile Bédard

Émile Bédard’s Mod Jam project is very playful through the different insect movements and the frog’s vertical upward movement, which gives the whole scene a fun sense of motion. The code supports this well overall, with clear organization and helpful comments that make it easy to understand how each part contributes to the experience. One thing I found challenging was the control keys, using A, L, and the space bar feels awkward since the keys are far apart, which interrupts the flow of the interaction. I was also unsure about the game’s objectives, since there’s no point system and I didn’t know how ants or spiders affect progression compared to flies. Adding an instruction page would help clarify goals for new players. On the coding side, there’s some repeated logic in the insect collision functions that could be simplified, and cleaning up a few spelling issues would make the code feel more polished. Overall, the movement and the vibe work really well, and with clearer goals and small refinements, the project could feel even stronger.

### Jake Hayduk

Jake Hayduk’s Mod Jam project has a fun sense of unpredictability thanks to the random fly movements, which keeps the gameplay feeling lively and chaotic in a good way. I also like the addition of a hard mode it gives the experience more depth and encourages players to try again with a new challenge although it would have been cool for the hard mode to have a distinct look or something to know that it's on. While the mechanics feel solid, I found myself wanting more exploration in the art direction. A stronger visual style could really enhance the overall atmosphere and make the world feel more distinct. Additionally, would have been cool for the game to have an end state when you win or lose instead of the regular title page. In the code, the movement and timing systems are clear and easy to follow, and I like how the countdown and stopwatch build tension before the action starts. However, the README is lacking a lot of information. Overall, it’s a neat with variety, and expanding the visual identity could push the experience even further.

### Nerly Cadet

Nerly Cadet’s Mod Jam project is visually amusing, the unicorn vibe is fun, and the rainbow GIF adds a magical, dynamic touch that really brings the scene to life. I love the mechanics of the game, moving the unicorn to catch flies is intuitive and engaging, and the health system with crowns adds a clear sense of stakes and progression. The inclusion of deadly flies and extra-life fairies introduces a nice challenge and keeps gameplay lively. The code itself is well-structured and easy to follow, particularly the movement and collision logic, as well as the system for updating health and score. The instructions and pre-game screens really set the tone. Overall, it’s a visually appealing, mechanically dynamic project that offers a fun and engaging experience.
